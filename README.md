# An Exploration of the California Housing Prices Dataset
This Python project uses 4 machine learning (ML) models to predict the median value of houses in California based on factors such as location, income, and population on housing values. It uses the [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) dataset on Kaggle.
